# MRHQ-mission7
I was tasked with building a page of a UX Designer's web design (their design was a classic, rather than modern, feel), and implementing a working "Property Search" page.

The page requests data from a MongoDB database, and then maps out that data on the search page (which can also be sorted by price). It has multiple conditional rendering components, as well as a form which has a variety of different input elements.
